 <p> As it turns out: Yes, they do. Multiple monitors actually make a positive difference when it comes to productivity.
I started to suspect this was true over the course of the past year, when I switched from working at various media companies and transitioned to freelance writing at home. It turns out there’s research to support my newfound discovery: For most office labor, employees benefit from multiple monitors, so if you — or even better, your employer — have a little extra cash and want to beef up productivity in a painless way, opening your wallet for an extra monitor or two is well worth it.
“If you have a lot of papers you’re working with on a project, would you rather work on a big conference table or an airline tray table?” says John Stasko, a professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has researched the effects of using multiple monitors. “I don’t know many people who’d trade their multi-mon setup and go back to a single monitor.”
“Would you rather work on a big conference table or an airline tray table?”
(“Multi-mon,” I’ve learned recently, is a phrase used by experts to refer to a “multiple-monitor” setup.)
This is what many respondents told me when I asked my extended Twitter network about their preferred monitor setups. “I find it reeeeeally odd now when I work remotely with my laptop and have to condense all my thoughts and tabs and apps back to one,” writes Becca Caddy, a technology journalist. “If I had the room, I’d even consider three.”
